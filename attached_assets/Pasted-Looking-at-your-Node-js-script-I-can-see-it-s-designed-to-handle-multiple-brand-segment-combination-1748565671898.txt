Looking at your Node.js script, I can see it's designed to handle multiple brand/segment combinations, but there are some issues with how it will work with the current stored procedure.
Current Issues:
1. Brand Mapping Mismatch
Your script expects these brand codes:
javascriptthis.brandMapping = {
  'Big Brand Tire': 'BBT',
  'American Tire Depot': 'ATD', 
  'Tire World': 'TW',
  'Robertson Tire': 'RT',        // ❌ Missing from proc
  'Tires To You': 'TTY',         // ❌ Missing from proc
But your script only has customer IDs and lists for BBT, ATD, TW - missing RT and TTY configurations.
2. Single Segment Call
The script calls the procedure once with @SegmentFilter = 'ALL', then processes the flags to assign customers to different lists. This is actually more efficient than calling the procedure multiple times.
Will it work for all 18 lists? YES, but with modifications needed:
Option 1: Quick Fix - Add Missing Brand Configs
Add to your script:
javascript// Add these to defaultConfig
RT_CUSTOMER_ID: process.env.RT_CUSTOMER_ID,
TTY_CUSTOMER_ID: process.env.TTY_CUSTOMER_ID,

// Add RT and TTY lists (6 each = 12 more lists)
RT_ALL_USER_LIST_ID: process.env.RT_ALL_USER_LIST_ID,
RT_TIRE_USER_LIST_ID: process.env.RT_TIRE_USER_LIST_ID,
// ... etc for all RT and TTY segments

// Update customers object
this.customers = {
  BBT: this.googleAdsClient.Customer({...}),
  ATD: this.googleAdsClient.Customer({...}),
  TW: this.googleAdsClient.Customer({...}),
  RT: this.googleAdsClient.Customer({
    customer_id: this.config.RT_CUSTOMER_ID,
    refresh_token: this.config.GOOGLE_ADS_REFRESH_TOKEN
  }),
  TTY: this.googleAdsClient.Customer({
    customer_id: this.config.TTY_CUSTOMER_ID,
    refresh_token: this.config.GOOGLE_ADS_REFRESH_TOKEN
  })
};
Option 2: Recommended - Update Proc for Script Compatibility
Since your script is well-designed to handle the segmentation logic, I'd recommend this approach:Script-Optimized Stored ProcedureCode -- Optimized version for the Node.js script
-- Always returns ALL segments with flags, script does the filtering

ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[GetNewCustomersForGoogleAdsWithBrandInfo] 
    @FullUpload BIT = 0 -- Only parameter needed for the script
AS
/*
Answer: YES, it will work for all 18 lists with a single command, BUT you need to:
1. Add Missing Brand Configurations

Add RT_CUSTOMER_ID and TTY_CUSTOMER_ID to your environment
Add all 12 missing list IDs for Robertson Tire and Tires To You
Update the customers object in your script

2. Use the Optimized Procedure Above

Removes the segment filter parameter (script handles filtering)
Always returns all customer data with flags
More efficient - single procedure call instead of multiple

3. Your Script Design is Actually Perfect
The approach of calling the procedure once and using JavaScript to filter customers into different lists is much more efficient than calling the procedure multiple times.
Single command that will upload to all 18 lists:
bashnode your-script.js --mode full
This will process all customers and distribute them across all configured brand/segment combinations in a single run!
